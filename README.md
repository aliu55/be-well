# Be Well

Be Well is a web app for those who want to improve their lifestyle/have trouble making decisions/too busy. The app allows users to plan their day with randomly generated recipes, workouts, and self-care activities. We built the frontend using Javascript and React with styling done by CSS. We also used the Edamam and Youtube APIs to generate options for recipes and fitness videos to randomize and display to the user.
